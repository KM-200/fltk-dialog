fltk-dialog
===========

This is a simple [FLTK](http://www.fltk.org/)-based dialog application.
It's in a very early stage. If you need something more stable and versatile
I recommend using [YAD](https://sourceforge.net/projects/yad-dialog/).

Note: the Makefile will automatically download and compile FLTK.
